<p>I recreated the iPhone Edit Alarm screen.  On the version above, <br>
users are forced to scroll through every number until they reach the one they want. <br> 
Instead of scrolling through all numbers, I created a design that would allow users <br>
to see every number on the screen at one time that they could click without scrolling (link below). <br> 
The screen displays each number in three separate sections:  hour, tens-minute, <br>
and ones-minute.  Users can select an alarm time by clicking the desired numbers <br>
without scrolling.  When they are finished, they can select ‘Save’ to be notified <br>
their alarm is set.  The app requires five clicks in completion:  hour, tens-minute, <br>
ones-minute, AM/PM, and Save. </p>
